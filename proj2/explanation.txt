In this part 2 of the project, I'm implementing an instruction simulator that supports a subset of RISC V instructions.
The program reads instructions from the binary file and execute the instructions one by one.
At the end of the execution, the program prints out the current value of the registers, and that should match with the expected output on a real RISC V processor.
